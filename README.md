2. To reduce “No Show” rate of C&P clinics from 10% to 7%
3. To increase appointment scheduling efficiency by 25% per day
4. To achieve and maintain Veteran satisfaction of > 95% through the improved notification process

End State: Reduce cost per notification by 20%. Reduce “No Show” rate of C&P clinics from 10% to 7%. Increase appointment scheduling efficiency by 25% per day. Achieve and maintain Veteran satisfaction of > 95% through the improved notification process.

Recommended Next Steps: With the pilot program completed, a brainstorming session with other medical departments would be helpful. Develop plan/training to spread the program to other specialty areas and facilities.
